In order to generate a benchmark dataset, the user has to do the following:

1- Ensure that BED file that highlights the Nm modified locations on the whole genome is in the same path where main.py file exists:

2- Run the following python command:

python main.py -r ref.fa -f reads.fastq

Where 

ref.fa referes to the reference Genome file
reads.fastq referes to the fastq reads file of a specific cell line.

By runnung the command above, the main.py script will lunch several command lines for generating eventalign output. These commanad lines are included in generate_event_align_output.txt
Meanwhile the main.py will call gen_coors_Nm.py for generating the coordinate file that will be input  together with the eventalign output to  extract_nm.py for generating the benchmark dataset

Note:

-Running gen_coors_Nm.py will prompt the user to enter the BED file name with extension

-The user should include the fast5 files folder (fast5_files) from which reads.fastq file was generated in the same path of main.py

-TO allow user practicing with generating benchmark dataset, we include the following:

1-A sample of fast5 files for the hela cell line in fast5_files folder 
2-A sample of fastq files (reads.fastq) for the same cell line 
3-A sample of reference genome (ref.fa)
4-A sample of bed file for hela cell line (hela.bed.txt)
